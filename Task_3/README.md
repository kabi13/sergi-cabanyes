# Task 3 - Testing RESTful API

## Getting Started

First of all you will need to set up the Best Buy API Playground and run it locally.
Set up your environment as explained in the [guide](https://github.com/bestbuy/api-playground/#getting-started).

After that you will need to clone this repo (make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kabi13/sergi-cabanyes
cd sergi-cabanyes/Task_3
npm install
```

Now to run the tests you just need to use:

```bash
npm test
```

*By default is assuming that you will have your API running on http://localhost:3030, if it's not the case you can change the URL in the ***config.json*** file*
